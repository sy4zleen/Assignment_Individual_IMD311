                  <p>Hello! I'm Nursyazleen Nadia and you can just call me Syaz! I am a student from Library Management under Information Science Studies College of Computing, Informatics and Media in Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM). Currently, I am on my last semester in Diploma. I will be turning 20 years old this year and I live in Bukit jelutong, which is located in Shah Alam, Selangor. I would like to decribe myself as an ambitious and driven person. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I am not comfortable with settling, and I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
